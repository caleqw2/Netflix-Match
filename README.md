# How to run app:
## React Front-end:
Make sure npm is installed through `npm install`. Then go to terminal and do `cd netflix-match` to go into React folder, then run `npm start` to run project and a window will pop up into your browser. To use one of the API end points, go to App.js and follow the format of the code already using the /hello end point.

## Flask Back-end:
Open a terminal and make sure you have cd'ed into Netflix-Match project folder. Then, run `flask run`. If you want to add more API end points, just make sure to make another function in app.py and change the name of the function and end point.
